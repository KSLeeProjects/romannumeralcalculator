### `Roman Numeral Calculator` 

This React App contains a partially implemented ADDITION function constituting a Roman numeral calculator. 

Your challenge is simply to make it work.

The user's input to the app is a list of numbers separated by commas. E.g. 1,2,3
The function’s input will be an array of ints E.g. [1,2,3].

The function’s output should be a string representing the total in Roman numeral. Note that 0 in Roman numerals is represented by the string “nulla”.

E.g.

3 + 2 = 5, so "V" should be your output
10 + 1 = 11, so "XI" should be your output
8 + 1 = 9, so "IX" should be your output

For simplicity, you can assume that no negative numbers will be passed in and all inputs we will be passing it for assessment will be valid (we won't be passing in characters or empty strings: a,2,,3)

### `npm install && npm start`
